# Self-Driving-Car-Neural-Networks-and-Machine-Learning
implement the car driving mechanics, define the environment,  simulate some sensors, detect collisions, make the car control itself using a neural network.

machine learning libraries like:
- Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org
- Scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org
